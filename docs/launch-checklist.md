## Remember

> "We're not building analytics software. We're building a decision engine that happens to use analytics."

Every feature, every line of code, every design choice should answer: **"Does this help the owner make a specific decision with a dollar value attached?"**

Ship fast. Start local. Let the money tell us what to build next.

**Ready to change how SMBs make decisions?**
