## üéØ **What I'll Ask For When I Need It**

I'll be proactive and ask for these things specifically when I hit each development phase:

### **This Week (I'll ask for):**
- "Ray, I need your Square sandbox credentials to test OAuth"
- "Ray, set up the Supabase project so I can create the database schema"  
- "Ray, I need your wife's spa data export to test matching"

### **Next Week (I'll ask for):**
- "Ray, time to deploy - need Railway and Vercel setup"
- "Ray, let's configure the keeper.tools domain DNS"

### **Later (I'll ask for):**
- "Ray, need access to review platforms for scraping setup"
- "Ray, ready to switch from sandbox to production Square API"

## üöÄ **Priority Order**

**Start immediately with:**
1. Square Developer Account + Sandbox keys
2. Supabase project
3. OpenAI API key

**Everything else I'll ask for as we reach those phases!**

I'll be specific about what I need and when, so you can prepare ahead of time or get it right when I need it.

**Ready to start as soon as you get the Square + Supabase + OpenAI credentials!** üéØ
