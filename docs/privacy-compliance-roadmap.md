# Keeper Privacy & Compliance Roadmap

## Philosophy
Start lean, scale compliance. Don't let perfect security prevent launch, but never compromise on basic data protection.

## Phase 1: Launch Ready (Week 1)
**Goal**: Basic security that protects customer data without slowing development

### Required Before First Customer
```yaml
Technical Security:
  - HTTPS everywhere (automatic with Vercel/Railway)
  - Database encryption at rest (Supabase default)
  - API authentication on all endpoints
  - Environment variables for secrets
  - No PII in logs

Legal Minimum:
  - Privacy Policy (generated from template)
  - Terms of Service (focus on data usage rights)
  - Cookie consent (if using analytics)
  
Data Handling:
  - Customer can request data deletion
  - 24-month automatic data retention
  - Encrypted backups daily
```

### Privacy Policy Key Sections
```markdown
## Data We Collect
- Square transaction data (with your permission)
- Customer information from your POS
- External files you upload
- Business review data (with your permission)

## How We Use Data
- Generate insights specific to your business
- Improve our algorithms (anonymized only)
- Never sold to third parties
- Never shared between customers (except anonymous patterns)

## Your Rights
- Export your data anytime
- Delete your account and all data
- Opt out of network learning
- Review what data we have
```

### Implementation
```python
# Basic security middleware
class SecurityMiddleware:
    def __init__(self):
        self.security_headers = {
            'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
            'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
            'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
            'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000'
        }
    
    def encrypt_pii(self, data):
        """Encrypt sensitive fields before storage"""
        sensitive_fields = ['email', 'phone', 'ssn', 'credit_card']
        
        for field in sensitive_fields:
            if field in data:
                data[field] = encrypt_field(data[field])
        
        return data
```

## Phase 2: First 10 Customers (Month 1-2)
**Goal**: Build trust and demonstrate security consciousness

### Enhanced Security
```yaml
Access Controls:
  - Role-based permissions (owner vs staff)
  - Session timeout after 30 minutes
  - Password requirements enforced
  
Audit Logging:
  - Track all data exports
  - Log permission changes
  - Record data deletion requests
  
Data Handling:
  - Implement data export API
  - Add "Download My Data" button
  - Create deletion workflow
```

### Customer Data Rights Portal
```python
@app.route('/my-data')
def customer_data_portal():
    """Self-service data management"""
    
    return {
        'export_data': '/api/export/all',
        'delete_account': '/api/delete/account',
        'review_permissions': '/api/permissions',
        'network_learning_opt_out': '/api/optout',
        'data_retention_policy': '/api/retention'
    }
```

### Security Questionnaire Prep
```markdown
Common questions from enterprise customers:
1. Is data encrypted at rest? YES (AES-256)
2. Is data encrypted in transit? YES (TLS 1.3)
3. Do you have SOC 2? Not yet (planned for 100+ customers)
4. GDPR compliant? YES (data portability, right to delete)
5. Where is data stored? US-East (Supabase/AWS)
```

## Phase 3: 50+ Customers (Month 3-6)
**Goal**: Formal security practices without enterprise overhead

### Security Enhancements
```yaml
Infrastructure:
  - Implement WAF (Cloudflare)
  - Add rate limiting per API key
  - Enable database query logging
  - Set up intrusion detection

Compliance Prep:
  - Document all data flows
  - Create incident response plan
  - Establish data breach protocol
  - Regular security updates

Monitoring:
  - Real-time threat detection
  - Anomaly alerts
  - Failed login tracking
  - API usage analytics
```

### Incident Response Plan
```python
class IncidentResponse:
    def detect_breach(self, event):
        severity = self.assess_severity(event)
        
        if severity == 'CRITICAL':
            # Immediate response
            self.isolate_affected_systems()
            self.notify_team_immediately()
            self.begin_forensics()
            
        if severity in ['CRITICAL', 'HIGH']:
            # Customer notification within 72 hours
            affected_customers = self.identify_affected(event)
            self.prepare_notification(affected_customers)
            
    def breach_notification_template(self):
        return """
        We detected [describe incident] on [date].
        Your data that may be affected: [list].
        Steps we've taken: [actions].
        Steps you should take: [recommendations].
        """
```

## Phase 4: 100+ Customers (Month 6-12)
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade security for SMB price point

### Formal Compliance
```yaml
SOC 2 Type I:
  - Hire auditor ($15-25k)
  - Document controls
  - 3-6 month process
  - Marketing advantage

PCI Compliance:
  - Required if storing card data
  - Use Square's PCI compliance
  - Never store card numbers

Insurance:
  - Cyber liability ($2M minimum)
  - Errors & omissions
  - General liability
```

### Advanced Security Features
```python
class EnterpriseSecurityFeatures:
    def __init__(self):
        self.features = {
            'sso': self.setup_sso(),  # Single sign-on
            'mfa': self.enforce_mfa(),  # Multi-factor auth
            'ip_allowlist': self.setup_ip_restrictions(),
            'api_key_rotation': self.automated_key_rotation(),
            'encryption_key_management': self.setup_kms()
        }
    
    def automated_security_scanning(self):
        """Weekly vulnerability scans"""
        scan_targets = [
            'dependencies',  # npm audit
            'docker_images',  # container scanning
            'api_endpoints',  # OWASP testing
            'database_queries'  # SQL injection testing
        ]
```

## Phase 5: Healthcare/Enterprise (Year 2+)
**Goal**: Expand into regulated industries

### HIPAA Compliance (If Needed)
```yaml
Requirements:
  - Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
  - Enhanced encryption standards
  - Detailed audit logs
  - Employee training program
  - Physical security controls

Implementation:
  - HIPAA-compliant hosting
  - Encrypted email communications
  - 7-year data retention
  - Annual risk assessments
```

## Data Handling Best Practices

### What We Store vs What We Don't
```python
# ALWAYS STORE
STORE = {
    'transaction_ids': 'encrypted',
    'customer_ids': 'hashed',
    'aggregated_metrics': 'clear',
    'pattern_embeddings': 'vectorized'
}

# NEVER STORE
NEVER_STORE = {
    'credit_card_numbers': 'use Square vault',
    'social_security_numbers': 'never needed',
    'medical_diagnoses': 'only general notes',
    'passwords_plaintext': 'always hashed'
}

# CAREFUL STORAGE
SENSITIVE = {
    'customer_notes': 'encrypted, owner access only',
    'email_addresses': 'encrypted, for notifications only',
    'phone_numbers': 'encrypted, for SMS only'
}
```

### Data Retention Policy
```python
RETENTION_POLICY = {
    'transaction_data': '24 months',
    'customer_profiles': '24 months after last activity',
    'insights': '12 months',
    'tasks': '90 days after completion',
    'logs': '90 days',
    'backups': '30 days rolling',
    'deleted_accounts': '30 days then permanent deletion'
}
```

## Customer Trust Builders

### Transparency Features
```python
@app.route('/security')
def security_page():
    """Public security page builds trust"""
    
    return {
        'current_status': 'All Systems Operational',
        'last_incident': 'None in past 90 days',
        'uptime': '99.95%',
        'certifications': ['SOC 2 Type I (pending)'],
        'security_measures': [
            '256-bit encryption',
            'Daily backups',
            'HTTPS only',
            'GDPR compliant'
        ],
        'data_location': 'United States',
        'third_party_sharing': 'Never',
        'last_updated': datetime.now()
    }
```

### Trust Signals in UI
- ðŸ”’ Lock icon on all data pages
- "Bank-level encryption" messaging
- Security badges in footer
- Clear data usage explanations
- One-click data export

## Compliance Cost Timeline

### Year 1 Costs
- Month 1-3: $0 (use platform defaults)
- Month 4-6: $500 (privacy policy review)
- Month 7-9: $2,000 (security audit)
- Month 10-12: $20,000 (SOC 2 Type I)

### Ongoing Costs
- Security monitoring: $200/month
- Compliance software: $300/month
- Annual audits: $10,000/year
- Cyber insurance: $3,000/year

## The Bottom Line

**Don't let compliance kill the launch.** Start with basics:
1. Encrypt everything
2. Give users control of their data
3. Be transparent about what you do
4. Build trust through actions, not certifications

Then scale compliance as you scale revenue. By the time you need SOC 2, you'll have the revenue to afford it.
