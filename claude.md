# Claude.md - Keeper Development Context

## üéØ Project Overview

**Keeper** is an AI-powered decision engine that transforms Square POS data into actionable business insights with dollar values attached. We find hidden revenue, prevent churn, and optimize operations for SMBs (specifically spas, salons, and similar service businesses).

**Domain**: keeper.tools  
**Repository**: https://github.com/raydawg88/Keeper  
**Owner**: Ray Hernandez (ray.hernandez@gmail.com)

## üìã Core Philosophy & Rules

### **BMAD Methodology**
- **Build** small increments
- **Measure** with real data  
- **Analyze** actual results
- **Deploy** only when verified

### **Non-Negotiable Requirements**
1. **Every insight MUST have a dollar value** - No generic advice
2. **97%+ matching accuracy** - Customer identity resolution is critical
3. **75%+ confidence threshold** - No uncertain insights
4. **No obvious insights** - Banned: "rain causes cancellations", "weekends are busier"
5. **Start with wife's spa** - Real validation before scaling
6. **Network learning from day 1** - Every customer makes every other customer smarter

### **Quality Gates**
- Confidence Check: >= 75% certainty
- Actionability Check: Specific action exists
- Obviousness Check: Not in banned_insights list
- Value Check: Dollar impact calculable
- Multi-Model Validation: 2+ models agree
- Network Enhancement: Apply collective intelligence when available

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Railway
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15) with pgvector
- **Cache**: Redis (Upstash)
- **Queue**: Celery + Redis
- **AI**: Claude 3 (Haiku/Sonnet), OpenAI (embeddings), Gemini (backup)

### **Core Tables**
```sql
accounts - Business accounts connected via Square OAuth
customers - Square customers + fuzzy matched external context
transactions - Square payments with modifiers extracted  
insights - Patterns detected by analysis tournament
tasks - Actionable insights with dollar values and scripts
network_patterns - Collective learning patterns (anonymized)
```

### **Agent System (8 Specialized Agents)**
1. **DataAgent** - Square data sync and storage
2. **MatchingAgent** - 97%+ accuracy fuzzy matching
3. **AnalysisAgent** - Pattern detection tournament
4. **EmployeeAgent** - Staff performance analysis  
5. **ReviewAgent** - Online review monitoring
6. **InsightAgent** - Convert patterns to actionable tasks
7. **NetworkLearningAgent** - Capture/apply collective intelligence
8. **ReportAgent** - McKinsey-style narrative reports

### **Key Performance Targets**
- **7x Speedup**: Parallel agent execution (70s ‚Üí 10s)
- **20% Boost**: Network learning confidence improvement
- **1000+ Scale**: Architecture proven for 1000+ accounts
- **<90 seconds**: First insight after Square connection
- **$3000+**: Hidden revenue discovery in test spa

## üîß Development Workflow

### **Git Commit Practice** 
**CRITICAL**: Commit progress regularly due to Claude usage limits
- After each working feature/component
- After successful tests  
- Before major refactoring
- Always include descriptive commit messages with ü§ñ Generated footer

**Commit Template**:
```

### **Development Phases**
1. **Week 1**: Data Pipeline (Square OAuth, sync, storage)
2. **Week 2**: Analysis Engine (RFM, modifiers, patterns) 
3. **Week 3**: Agent System (8 specialized agents)
4. **Week 4**: Interface (dashboards, reports, tasks)

### **Current Environment Status**
- ‚úÖ Square API: Connected (sandbox credentials)
- ‚úÖ Supabase: Database schema created, tables accessible
- ‚úÖ AI APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini configured
- ‚úÖ Development environment: Python virtual env with all dependencies

## üîí Security & Privacy

### **Data Protection**
- All Square API credentials encrypted
- Customer PII never logged or exposed
- Network learning patterns fully anonymized
- Environment variables protected in .gitignore

### **Network Learning Anonymization**
- Remove all customer names, emails, phone numbers
- Replace with generic markers [high_value_customer]
- Hash any remaining identifiers
- Store only pattern abstractions, never raw data

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### **BMAD Testing Approach**
- Use real spa data from Ray's wife's business
- 97%+ matching accuracy validation
- $3000+ revenue discovery requirement
- No obvious insights allowed in output

### **Test Data Requirements**
```
test-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ square-customers.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ square-transactions.csv  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ square-appointments.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ customer-notes.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staff-schedule.csv
```

### **Success Criteria**
- Find $3,000+ hidden revenue in test spa
- 97%+ customer matching accuracy
- 75%+ confidence on all insights  
- Zero obvious/generic insights
- <90 seconds to first insight

## üöÄ Network Learning System

### **Core Principle**
"Every customer makes every other customer smarter" - patterns discovered at one spa benefit all spas.

### **Pattern Types**
- **Churn Prevention**: Break in visit patterns, personalized win-back
- **Modifier Opportunities**: Employee coaching, time-based upselling
- **Review Response**: Template responses for different scenarios
- **Employee Issues**: Performance problems, coaching recommendations

### **Network Effect Timeline**
- Month 1-3: 100 patterns from 10 customers
- Month 4-6: 1,000+ patterns, cross-category insights
- Month 7-12: 10,000+ patterns, new customers get instant intelligence
- Year 2+: Competitive moat established

## üìà Scale Architecture

### **Proven Capacity**
- **Database**: Supabase handles 10+ billion rows easily
- **At 1,000 accounts**: 300,000 rows (trivial), 50GB storage (10% of tier)
- **API Processing**: FastAPI handles 1,000 req/sec, horizontal scaling ready
- **Queue System**: Redis 10,000 req/sec, Celery infinitely scalable

### **Cost Scaling**
- 100 accounts: $75/month (0.75% of revenue)
- 1,000 accounts: $1,200/month (1.2% of revenue)  
- 10,000 accounts: $10,700/month (1.07% of revenue)

## üîÑ Square API Resilience

### **Adaptive Rate Limiting**
- No fixed rate limits assumed
- Learn from 429 responses dynamically
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Circuit breaker pattern for outages
- Request prioritization (critical/high/normal/low)

### **Graceful Degradation**
- Use cached data when Square is down
- Notify users of reduced functionality
- Queue requests for retry when service resumes

## üéØ Current Development Status

### **‚úÖ Completed**
- Project setup and environment configuration
- Square API integration and testing
- Supabase database schema creation
- All AI API keys configured and validated
- Comprehensive documentation and architecture

1. **Square OAuth Flow** - Real business connection
2. **Data Sync Pipeline** - Customer/transaction import
3. **Fuzzy Matching Engine** - 97%+ accuracy customer resolution
4. **Insight Tournament** - Multi-model pattern detection
5. **Task Generation** - Actionable insights with scripts
6. **Agent Coordination** - Parallel processing system
7. **Network Learning** - Pattern capture and application
8. **Frontend Dashboard** - Next.js interface

### **üé™ Ready to Build**
